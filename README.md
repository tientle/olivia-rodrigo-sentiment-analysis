## Description
Just of out curiosity, I wanted to run a sentiment analysis on Olivia Rodrigo's albums and make some data visualizations out of them. 

I collected the tracklist and lyrics data myself. The sentiment analysis code was adapted from Codecademy's Taylor Swift lyrics analysis.

I created the base data visualizations in https://www.rawgraphs.io/, downloaded them as SVGs, imported into Illustrator, and then edited them further. 

Enjoy and happy listening! ðŸ’œðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§
